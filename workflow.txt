fork on github
git clone
git checkout -b my-solution
git add .
git commit -m ""
git checkout master
git push origin my-solution
// Added
And then submit pull request origin my-solution > upstream ???. I have had issues in the past with submitting a pull request for a branch that only exists in a forked repo and not the upstream... I would like more information about how this works.


// Did not use
git merge my-solution
git pull upstream master
git fetch --all
