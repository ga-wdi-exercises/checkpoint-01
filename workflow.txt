Not quite sure about the wording of this question so I'm just going to write out
the steps to what I think it is that you're looking for along with comments so you
know I know what I'm doing.

fork on github
//assume that the repo that I'm branching and pull requesting is similar to the hw
we've been doing, in that case I'll need my own fork of it//
git clone
//grab the ssh link from my fork of the repo in question and clone it//
git checkout -b my-solution
//this creates and shifts the head to my new branch//
git add .
//run this after having made changes to move changes to staging area//
git commit -m ""
//run this to make a commit to local repo with comment//

here you could go two ways

1. you could
git push origin my-solution
//this would create a new branch in your remote repo and push your local branch to
it. You could then submit a pull request via github's gui.

 2. you could instead
 git remote add upstream <whatever>
git fetch --all
git pull upstream master

and that would work too.
