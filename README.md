## HTML

### #1

Open up `index.html` in a text editor and browser. Link to the provided stylesheet.

file:///Users/tarikkazanci/wdi/exercises/checkpoint-01/index.html

### #2

Identify one non-semantic tag and replace it with a semantic one.

> Commit

### #3

Something is missing from the image tag. Fix the HTML.

> Commit

### #4

Change the title of the page. Specifically, change what shows in the tab of the page (i.e., at the top of the browser).

> Commit

### #5

Set the margin to 0 for each direct child of...

- `header`
- `footer`
- `.main`
- `aside`

> Commit

### #6

If you inspect the `.left` and `.right` elements, you will see that they have `width: 50%;` and `float: left`. They are not, however, sitting next to each other.

Fix this issue without modifying any of `.left` and `.right`'s `padding`, `border`, or `width`.

> Commit

### #7

When the page is fewer than 600px wide, the background of `.main` turns red. The code responsible for this is located in the [`@media`](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp) query at the bottom of the stylesheet.

Instead of making `.main` red, reorder the elements to...

1. Header
2. Main
3. Aside
4. Aside
5. Footer

Do this using only CSS -- do not rearrange the HTML.

### #8
