Something about the image tag is incorrect. Fix the error.

Commit

Change the title of the page. Specifically, change what
shows in the tab of the page.

Commit

### #5

Set the margin to 0 for each direct child of:

- `header`
- `footer`
- `.main`
- `aside`

Commit

### #6

If you inspect element, you'll see that both
`.left` and `.right` have `width:50%;` and `float:left`, yet they are not sitting next to each other.

Fix this issue without modifying any of `.left` and `.right`'s `padding`, `border`, or `width`.

Commit

### #7

When the page is fewer than 600px wide, the background
of .main turns red.

Instead of making .main red, reorder the elements to:

1. Header
2. Main
3. Aside
4. Aside
5. Footer

Using CSS only.
